## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

Using the `MechaCar_mpg.csv` dataset, we created a linear model for the dataset[^1], and stored the result as `mpg_lm`.

[^1]: using `lm(mpg ~ vehicle_length + vehicle_weight + spoiler_angle + ground_clearance + AWD, data=mcmpg)`

`mpg_lm` showed the following output:

Coefficients:
     (Intercept)    vehicle_length    vehicle_weight     spoiler_angle  ground_clearance               AWD
      -1.040e+02         6.267e+00         1.245e-03         6.877e-02         3.546e+00        -3.411e+00

A summary of `mpg_lm` (generated by running `summary(mpg_lm)`) showed the following output:

By examining the `Pr(>|t|)` column, we see the probability that the contribution of each factor toward the vehicles' `mpg` ratings is a result of random chance.

Three of the factors---`vehicle_length` (P-value = 2.60×10<sup>-12</sup>), `vehicle_weight` (P-value = 0.0776), and `ground_clearance` (P-value = 5.21×10<sup>-08</sup>)---show small or very small probabilities that their contributions are random, which indicates that they might have a non-negligible effect on `mpg`.

The `(Intercept)` also shows statistical significance (P-value = 5.08×10<sup>-08</sup>), meaning that it explains a significant amount of variability in `mpg` when all the other examined factors (independent variables) are 0.

Given the presence of statistically significant slope factors in the linear model, we can reject the claim that the linear model has a slope of zero (null hypothesis H<sub>0</sub>: m = 0), and conclude that it most-likely does have a non-zero slope (alternative hypothesis H<sub>1</sub>: m ≠ 0).

The model's `R²` value of 0.7149 indicates a strong degree of correlation, and so this model appears to be a reasonably good predictor of MechaCar protypes' `mpg` values.
